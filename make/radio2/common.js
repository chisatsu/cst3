Radio buttons are hard to style in polished ways while still retaining their accessibility features.

You can tell when these radio buttons have focus. Use the up/down/right/left keyboard arrows to navigate between them after. 

If you can't tell which one has focus or if you're focused on that element at all, then it's not accessible. In general, try not to rely on JS to make things accessible. Semantic HTML is pretty dang accessible already.
